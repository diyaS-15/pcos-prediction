# PCOS Prediction 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on devloping a logistic regression classifier to predict PCOS diagnosis using a dataset with the medical indicators. Additionally, I implemented differntial privacy to enhance privacy protections and follow HIPPA regulations. 
The model evaluated at 91.2% accuracy. 

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas for data preprocessing, DiffPrivLib to implement differential privacy, Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize results. 

Future Implementations: Future implementations could include fine-tuning the model to better recall and precision.
